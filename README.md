# ownCoin

## Work in progress...

Goal : providing a simple way to manage a bitcoin daemon with a user-friendly user interface.

Still in development. A Readme will come, one day...

The UI should be reachable ONLY through a VPN or something like that.
NEVER expose ownCoin directly to the web, it could be CATASTROPHIC.
